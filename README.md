## About The Project

This project came about because the job I was at needed something like this for our office. We had a few small things that we did not keep over in our warehouse like mouse and keyboards, displayport cables, displayport adapters, etc. So, after struggling to keep up with how many we needed, how many we were going through, how often we needed to order them. I made this little desktop application that would connect to a database and keep track of all of our products. I also managed to implement barcode scanning to make it much easier on us. There were a few features that I would have like to implement such as sending an email to designated people once supply was low on an item, but never could quite figure out how to get that functioning. However, it served its purpose and helped me keep up with the office inventory.
